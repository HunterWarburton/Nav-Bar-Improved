# Nav-Bar-Improved
 React Nav Bar Improved


## DESCRIPTION
This is an example of a Ract Nav Bar but made to look like a circle. Hovering over the links changes the color of the content div and clicking loads content from other pages into the main page div.


## Features/Learning Purposes
This project demonstrates React navigation


## IMPROVEMENTS
The page Links have been made to be created and loaded through javascript. The links are able to update the main page background color just by hovering over the links.


## HOW TO USE
This Nav Bar Circle allows for more links to be added by simply adding more objects to the links array, making it easily expandable


## ROADMAP of FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
This project needs more styling to be useable. Both the content container and the Nav Bar Circle itself should be positioned on the page better.
